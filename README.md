# Kinen Space

Your personal workspace for AI-powered sessions.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork this repo** to your account
2. **Push anything** to trigger setup (or just wait for the fork event)
3. **Check your email** for your inbox address
4. **Start a session** by emailing your inbox

That's it!

## What is Kinen?

Kinen is a round-based methodology for working through complex problems with AI. It works via email:

- **Email your inbox** to start a session
- **AI asks questions** in return
- **You answer** by replying
- **Repeat** until you're done

All your work is saved to this repo as structured files.

## Session Types

Kinen works for any iterative thinking process:
- Technical architecture reviews
- Writing projects (articles, books, scripts)
- Strategic planning
- Research and analysis
- Design reviews
